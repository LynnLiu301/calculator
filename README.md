# calculator

It is a calculator program in Java that evaluates expressions in a very simple integer expression language. 
The program :
1.Takes an input on the command line.
2.Computes the result.
3.Prints it to the console.


There is a example input:

java Cal "add(1,1)"

4

Note: User has to quote their input like "user input here"

Since I don't have log4J, I use some equivalent logging.

Three level of logs : info  -> logging.info
                      error -> longging.warning
                      DEBUG -> //System print
